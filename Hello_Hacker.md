# Intro to Commands

### The challenge introduced commands like whoami which returns your name, and hello.

**Flag:** `pwn.college{AjnfdBUjLEsq4vRGuiFwlpvsnWi.QX3YjM1wCO0EzNzEzW}`

I followed the instructions and it was quite straightforward, the biggest challenge was getting the SSH handshake to work.

```
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ whoami
hacker
hacker@hello~intro-to-commands:~$ hello
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{AjnfdBUjLEsq4vRGuiFwlpvsnWi.QX3YjM1wCO0EzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned: I learnt how to make a SSH link and how to make sure that the commands are typed properly without even a minute error.

# Intro to Arguments

### Introduces arguments like echo, which just repeates whatever you type after it.

***Flag:*** `pwn.college{c3paSKTGHTn-xxjivy9WZfM7s3Y.QX4YjM1wCO0EzNzEzW}` 

```
hacker@hello~intro-to-arguments:~$ hello hackers
Success! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{c3paSKTGHTn-xxjivy9WZfM7s3Y.QX4YjM1wCO0EzNzEzW}
```

## What I learned: a command like echo, hello works with arguments which can be anything.

```
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{gmtyaKyQ4b2Lo4cTUFu0SmuzZNX.0lNzEzNxwCO0EzNzEzW}
